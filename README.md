# Heart-Failure-Prediction
This project uses the UCI Machine Learning Repository's heart failure clinical records dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+failure+clinical+records). \n
With this project I aim to probabilistically predict if a patient has a heart failure risk using Bayesian machine learning models.
